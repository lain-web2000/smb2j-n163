# Super Mario Bros. 2 (Japan) N163 Port

A port of the Japanese Super Mario Bros. 2 to the N163 mapper.

__This build has issues with the original Everdrive N8, it will randomly crash, or experience many weird behaviours such as randomly switching CHR banks or play random sound effects (any help to resolve these issues would be greatly appreciated)__
